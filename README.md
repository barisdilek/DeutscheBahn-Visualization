# Infrastructure Visualisation Coding Challenge

In this coding challenge you are given the task to implement a small JavaScript application to
visualize a graph network. For that you have an infrastructure file which contains a JSON object
with all the needed information to render the network.

The result should look similar to this:

![alt infrastructure example](output-example.png "Example Infra")

You are free to choose a drawing/visualization method of your choice. The nodes should have a thick
outline as a hover effect and the color of the nodes should change (and stay changed) if the user
selects them via a click. Only one node can be marked as selected at the same time.

*Hint: You can render svg elements directly in jsx like this* `<line />` 

The given JSON file can be loaded directly in your application (no need for a file upload, etc.).

Since we mainly use React in combination with TypeScript, we encourage you to also use this stack.
But if you don't feel comfortable enough using either of the two you are also free to use any other
framework and/or plain JavaScript.

Please write the implementation with the highest quality standards in mind which you would also use
for production code. Visual correctness of the rendered network is the most important criterion.
After that it will be evaluated in terms of maintainability and code style. Please submit
everything you have written, including documentation and tests.

Feel free to use supporting libraries as long as they are available on npm.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
